Hey Professor, Masato, and Shikun!
Since my game is a 2 play game, I'm including a readme so you can play together!

*Game Objective*
There are 3 lanes to fight over. In Each lane, you have 2 cards. The goal is to get the highest combined power in each lane.
At the start of your turn you have 2 moves. You can spend a move to either put a random card in the shop, or buy the face up card in the shop and replace it
with one of the spirits (facedown card)

Optimally you try to pick high cards and replace them with low cards. You also want to look out for getting the same suits in your lane. Having 2 cards
of the same suit actually gives you a +5 bonus and also the little pixel art guys I drew do a cute dance :) 

The game ends when one player has all 6 cards face up. This forces the other player to flip the spirits over and take the random card and then battle.

Anyway, there are tons of different strategies you can use, and I think its relatively fast paced so I hope you enjoy!

Sincerely,
Sam
